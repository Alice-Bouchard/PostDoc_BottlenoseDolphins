# Playback Experiment: Summary of Results

## 1. Model Results

**Table 1. Model results for female behavioural responses to male playback experiments.**

| Response variable       | Predictor                                              | Estimate | SE   | Confidence interval | *p* value |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|------|---------------------|-----------|
| (a) Response duration  | Avoidance response (yes / no)                          | 0.82     | 0.29 | 0.26 to 1.38        | **0.008** |
|                        | Female reproductive state (available / not)           | 0.91     | 0.30 | 0.33 to 1.50        | **0.005** |
| (b) Avoidance distance | Male sociability                                       | -0.13    | 0.20 | -0.72 to -0.01      | 0.521     |
|                        | Male consortship rate                                  | 0.05     | 0.21 | -0.38 to 0.47       | 0.831     |
|                        | Female reproductive state (available / not)           | 0.63     | 0.29 | 0.03 to 1.23        | **0.040** |
|                        | Female reproductive state × Male consortship rate     | 1.02     | 0.31 | 0.39 to 1.66        | **0.002** |
| (c) Approach distance  | Female reproductive state (available / not)           | 0.44     | 0.81 | -0.67 to 3.17       | 0.600     |
| (d) Orientation to source | Female reproductive state (available / not)        | 1.47     | 1.32 | -1.21 to 4.16       | 0.283     |
|                        | Male sociability                                       | -0.70    | 0.61 | -1.95 to 0.55       | 0.272     |

**Notes:**  
Parameter estimates were averaged over the top model set based on AIC selection (∆AIC ≤ 2).  
Female ID (subject) and Male ID (playback stimulus) were included as random effects.  
*p* values in **bold** indicate significant results (*p* < 0.05).  
Fixed effects included in the full models: dyadic consortship rate + female sociability + male sociability + male cumulative bond strength + long-term familiarity + dyadic social bond strength + home range overlap + female reproductive state × male consortship rate.  
For the response duration model (a) and the orientation to source model (d), the variable avoidance response (yes / no) was also included as a fixed effect.
