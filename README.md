# Social Relationships in wild bottlenose dolphins â€“ Postdoctoral Research

This repository contains the code and visualisations from my postdoctoral research project on female-male social relationships in Shark Bayâ€™s bottlenose dolphins.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Summary

My work explored how factors like home range overlap, consortship rates, and long-term familiarity shape social associations between female and male bottlenose dolphins. Using long-term observational and experimental approaches, I applied various statistical models to assess these relationships.
